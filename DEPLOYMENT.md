# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `student-outreach-tracker`
3. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have files)

### 2. Push Your Code
```bash
# Initialize git in your project folder
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Student Outreach Tracker"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-outreach-tracker.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### 4. Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your app
- Check the **Actions** tab to see deployment progress
- Usually takes 2-3 minutes for first deployment

### 5. Access Your App
Your app will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/student-outreach-tracker/
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Automatic Deployment
- Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
- GitHub Actions builds the Next.js app as static files
- Files are deployed to GitHub Pages automatically
- No manual steps needed after initial setup

### Static Export Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.js - Configured for static export
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',      // Enables static export
  trailingSlash: true,   // Required for GitHub Pages
  images: { unoptimized: true }  // Optimizes for static hosting
}
```

### Build Process
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm ci`
2. **Build static files**: `npm run build`
3. **Deploy to Pages**: Publishes `./out` folder

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå Build fails with module errors**
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Run `npm install` locally to verify

**‚ùå 404 errors on GitHub Pages**
- Ensure repository is **Public**
- Check that **Source** is set to **GitHub Actions**
- Wait a few minutes after enabling Pages

**‚ùå Pages not updating**
- Check **Actions** tab for build status
- Make sure latest commit pushed to `main` branch

### Manual Local Build Test
```bash
# Test the build process locally
npm run build

# Check that ./out folder is created with static files
ls -la out/
```

## üåü Next Steps

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Add `CNAME` file to repository root with your domain
2. Configure DNS to point to `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
3. Enable HTTPS in repository settings

### Updates & Maintenance
- Push changes to `main` branch for automatic deployment
- Monitor **Actions** tab for deployment status
- App remains completely client-side and privacy-compliant

---

## üì± Sharing Your App

Once deployed, you can share your app with:
- Students and staff who need to track outreach
- Anyone needing a privacy-compliant tracking tool
- Educational institutions requiring secure data handling

**URL Format**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/student-outreach-tracker/`

**Ready for deployment! üéâ**
